Features :
1. Webpage hosting by ESP
2. Establishing a private network.
3. Syncing data from mobile to the ESP with a SINGLE TAP.
4. Display of Homepage containing Time, day, date, and tasks received from mobile.

When the "Update" button is pressed on the webpage, the ESP watch face changes to "Updating..!!" for 3 seconds and in this time,
all the data is updated and ready to be displayed.
Then the updated data is displayed and the time is updated by the internal RTC code block.

Drawback - After every power disconnection, everything is lost. Reconnection and updating is required.

Which means if your watch runs out of charge, you need to update after recharging it.

Battery icon is also displayed and will be synced with the battery_monitoring system once Seed Studio XIAO ESP32 C3 is obtained.
